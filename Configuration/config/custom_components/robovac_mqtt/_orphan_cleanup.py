"""Shared helper for pruning entity-registry orphans.

When entities are conditionally created (e.g., gated by transport type or
api_type) the previous build may have registered entities the current build
no longer provides. HA keeps those registry entries forever, so they show as
permanently-unavailable on the device page until the user manually deletes
them. This helper removes the diff at platform setup.
