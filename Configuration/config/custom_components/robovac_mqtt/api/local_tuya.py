"""Local Tuya transport for Eufy Clean devices.

Provides a push-based alternative to the Tuya Cloud polling path: the dock
publishes DPS updates over its LAN socket (port 6668) using the Tuya local
protocol. Same DPS payloads as the cloud path, just delivered instantly.

Built on the `tinytuya` library which handles v3.3 / v3.4 / v3.5 protocol
framing, encryption and session negotiation. All DPS values arrive in the
same {"dps": {key: value}} envelope used elsewhere in the integration, so
the existing parser/commands modules consume them unchanged.

Compared with the cloud transport this gives:
- ~immediate state updates instead of 30 s polling
- works while Eufy / Tuya cloud is unreachable
- requires LAN reachability between HA and the dock plus the device's
  16-character local key (auto-discovered from the user's Tuya Cloud login)
